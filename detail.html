       Being a woman affects everything one does. In society woman are still treated in a lot of cases as lesser than males. In 2019 Women are still earning 79 cents for every dollar earned by men for exactly the same jobs.

    <p> Technology is an extremely fast paced and desirable industry in this time period. Constant breakthroughs in technology result in rapidly growing companies. Demand for ‘stuff’ is greater than ever. This society lives of the new and the latest and companies like Apple use this to there advantage. Bringing out new products making perfectly good products seem old and no longer desirable. Tech is where employment is. Yet Statistics show that woman make up over 50% of the US workforce but under 20% of US tech jobs.

I was lucky enough to attended a conversation between Reshma Saujani and  Janaye Ingram during the fest of the New.The title of the talk was ‘The new approach to Inspiring Women and Girls in Tech.I was drawn to this talk because Reshma Saujani, is the founder of the foundation “Girls who code” and I was curious to find out more.
Reshma explained that she created Girls who code when she was running for Congress. During her running she travelled the globe and out of the many things she was exposed to, one of the most prevalent was the underrepresentation of women in the tech industry. Tech is the future, and women aren't in it. They aren't educated , advised or swayed in that direction. Reshma realized that this was a big issue considering the way the worlds industry was, is and will continue to shift to.

    Girls who code is an organization that teaches girls/women to code. Through collaboration, projects, pitches and technical training, they are trained to be perfect candidates for big tech companies. The issue still  lies in the fact that woman are not hired,  whether they are qualified or not.

    “Experts believe lack of female mentors and gender inequality are some of the factors responsible for this trend.” Data prooved that one of the reasons that woman were not involved in this field was the lack of mentors to look up to. 200,000  girls now have learnt to code through girls who code.

    </p>

Reshma was proof that her interest in providing woman with opportunity and being passionate about this matter will pay of. Starting of with no coding or tech background, Reshma managed to start this whole organization with great success.

   This talk left me thinking about the different roles women take and the stereotypes we are still bound to to this day. Sometimes we/I am in denial about the harsh reality of being a women in this day in age. I wouldn't want to believe that I am worst of, that I have less opportunity. This talk inspired me to think outside the box.

        Another woman I am really inspired by  is Pat Mcgrath. She is a self taught makeup artist who completely took over the makeup industry.Her makeup looks are the perfect combination of experimental and fun but elegant and simplistic. Pat did a desert island disks podcast and talks about sneaking into fashion shows using fake passes.  These  are the same shows she is now doing the makeup for. Pat also came out with her own products and used it as an opportunity to play and design when it came to packaging and marketing. Everything is so chic and futuristic. In an industry like makeup there is so much opportunity to stand out but its not easy. There are thousands of brands, millions of artists and she shows that if you create your own independent style and stand out then you can succeed.  

        </p>

<p>
    Although Reshma Saujani and Pat Mcgrath are in two completely different industries that may seem worlds apart, they are both examples of woman who inspired and made a change. They both inspire me to be the best I can be and not give up on my goals.
